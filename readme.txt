Use the exceptional <strong>Row and Columns blocks</strong> to add dynamically generated content areas with specific <strong>responsive margin and padding settings</strong> that only CoBlocks provides.

Style these with innovative new blocks such as the Shape Divider, which lets you split up your content with beautiful dividers.

Each of the WordPress blocks within CoBlocks have been precisely fined tuned to offer a familiar, yet powerful, customization experience. Tailor each block to your taste using our custom controls and settings. <strong>Change fonts, set margin and padding, pick colors and more.</strong>

## Custom Typography Controls
The breakthrough Typography Control Panel within CoBlocks lets you design web pages with alluring typographic elements. <strong>Set fonts, sizes, weights, transformations and more</strong>, in our CoBlocks blocks, <em>and</em> in core WordPress blocks.

## Free Companion Theme
CoBlocks is built to show off the best of Gutenberg, but it requires a Gutenberg-first theme to unlock its full potential. We also created the free [Go theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/go/) in the WordPress theme repository as the perfect companion for CoBlocks.

## Going Beyond Gutenberg Blocks
The vision for CoBlocks is to create a suite of Gutenberg blocks to help folks make beautiful websites easily. These newest releases of CoBlocks is the ultimate expression of that vision.
