Style these with innovative new blocks such as the Shape Divider, which lets you split up your content with beautiful dividers.

Each of the WordPress blocks within CoBlocks have been precisely fined tuned to offer a familiar, yet powerful, customization experience. Tailor each block to your taste using our custom controls and settings. <strong>Change fonts, set margin and padding, pick colors and more.</strong>

## Free Companion Theme
CoBlocks is built to show off the best of Gutenberg, but it requires a Gutenberg-first theme to unlock its full potential. We also created the free [Go theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/go/) in the WordPress theme repository as the perfect companion for CoBlocks.

## Going Beyond Gutenberg Blocks
