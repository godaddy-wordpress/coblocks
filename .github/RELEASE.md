# Release a New Version

This document walks you though how to run a release, which is mostly automated, but requires a few manual inputs and steps to ensure the release runs smoothly.

## Create a Milestone

Creating a Milestone is the first step for releasing a new version, as closing the Milestone will trigger the [Release Action Workflow](.github/workflows/create-release.yml), which tags the new version and creates the release.

Each new Milestone MUST have a title (semver tag number) and a description (markdown), which are transposed into the tag name, release title and description within the workflow.

__Title Requirements:__
1. Title MUST match a semver format.
2. Title MUST NOT be a tag that already exists in the repo.

### Pull Requests and Issues

At a minimum, a Milestone MUST include the related Pull Request with incoming changes. In addition, it is required that all related Issues and Pull Requests  including changes be attached to the Milestone. This ensures clear understanding of what is changing.

Furthermore, both Pull Requests and Issues MUST be closed (or moved) prior to the Milestone close, and the Milestone itself MUST show a 100% completion before closing.

1. Pull Requests MUST be merged, or moved to another Milestone.
2. Issues MUST be closed, or moved to another Milestone.

> :bulb: HOTTIP â€” Closing an issue with a pull request is recommended, and can be automated using [GitHub's linking keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

## Update Changelog in readme.txt

Building off the description of the Milestone, the changelog in the `readme.txt` file MUST be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. The content of the readme.txt changelog is used to populate the release notes on WordPress.org.

Because WordPress.org requires a specific format for the changelog, the changelog in the readme.txt file MUST be updated manually. This means that each description in the Milestone MUST be copied and pasted into the readme.txt file, but only in list format, excluding any headings or other formatting.

The best way to follow the correct format is to copy a previous changelog entry, and then update the version number, date and list content.

## Close Milestone

Once all the Pull Requests and Issues are closed (or moved), the Milestone will show a 100% completion, and it is then ready to close. Closing the Milestone will trigger the Release Workflow, which will build and bundle the plugin, tag a new version, and create a new Release on GitHub, and deploy the newly created tag version to WordPress.org.
